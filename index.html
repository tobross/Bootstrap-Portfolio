            Greetings! My name is Nathanial but most people call me Tobey. I'm happy to say that I am now a developer! Through UT's Coding Bootcamp, I have taken the dive into web and software development!  I'm very excited to have finally found a type of learning and skillset that I understand fluidly and am excited to learn! This page that you're seeing currently is my very first homework assignment! On this page you will find links to other pages including a page linking to future projects (links inactive at this time), and a contact page! This is all just for show right now, as there is no .php to back up the comment page. So, enjoy my site and feel free to put further improvement suggestions, which I will never receive!
    </p>
    <p>
            As for my background; I am originally from Granbury, TX. I grew up in a bible town and graduated in a class of 400. I Left home and went to TSTC in Waco for a welding degree. After a few months in school, I was robbed blind and had to return home due to financial and safety reasons. I took this time to reflect and enter the workforce. A year later, I moved to Dallas and began work as an Overnight Auditor. After two years of working solidly, women coming and going, saving and spending, I was robbed again and decided to move to Austin, TX near my sister.
    </p>    
    <p>
            Once I arrived in Austin, life really started for me. I was able to make friends readily. I began to develop hobbies. Becoming a bassist and quadcopter pilot gave my off time direction and meaning! When I met my wife, the rest of my life gained color! I became a brewer and baker, at work I became a manager of my fellow butchers, and I sold my first house to pave the way for our future!
    </p>
    <p>
            This class is the next step in the five-year plan! After this, I will be fit, employed, and moving my family to Colorado to start the next chapter of out life! I have picked up blacksmithing and hope to buy land and home with room to incorporate that and homesteading! Now, if you've read all of this, you understand my drive, where I've been, and where I'm going! So, here's to the future!
